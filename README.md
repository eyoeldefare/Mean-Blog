# Mean-Blog ------ Please note that this app doesn't use universal rendering.
Mean blog example.
This is a personal blog I have made for my online journal to teach what I know about web development online and also talk about the future technologies that I think we will be seeing in the near future. This blog will focus on programming, web development, and AI/Machine Learning. 
Note that I have since stop posting on this blog due to it was too much work for me to convert it to use universal rendering for SEO optimization. I have rather moved on to work on other web applications.
The technology used to build this application is MEAN stack. 

# Technologies used
-Angular 4 (Typescript) 
frontend 
I used angular4 to make this website. You can view all the packages and libraries used in this project by going to the frontend folder and viewing under package.json.


-html5/css3/bootstrap 
view rendering - I used bootstrap, css3, and html5 for a quick development. 


-nodejs
backend - For the backend, I used nodejs with express server. There are many frameworks and libraries used to create the server and you can see those under the package.json file in the root directory.

-Mongodb
Database - Nodejs is popular with noSQL databases so I selected to use it with MongoDB. All real time datas are served from mlab and the mongoose node framework is used to integrate with database.
# Web url
The url for this web application is https://tekminator.herokuapp.com.
The host for this application is heroku (cloud).
The host for the data for this application is mlab.

My gratitude goes out to DAVID ACOSTA who taught me most of what I know about MEAN stack technology.
